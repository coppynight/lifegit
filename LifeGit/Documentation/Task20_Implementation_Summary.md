4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Lazy Loading**: Statistics calculated on-demand
2. **Memory Management**: Efficient cache with automatic cleanup
3. **Data Aggregation**: Optimized queries for large datasets
4. **Background Processing**: Heavy calculations performed asynchronously

### User Experience Features
1. **Real-time Updates**: Statistics refresh automatically
2. **Interactive Controls**: Timeframe selection for customized analysis
3. **Visual Feedback**: Loading states and error handling
4. **Accessibility**: Proper color coding and text formatting

## Integration Points
