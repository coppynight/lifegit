# Product Overview

## 人生Git (Life Git)

人生Git is an innovative iOS personal goal management application that applies Git version control concepts to life goal management. Users' lives are treated as complete Git projects, with the main life as the master branch and each new goal creating independent branches for management.

### Core Concept
- **Master Branch**: Represents the user's main life timeline with version numbers (v1.0, v2.0...)
- **Goal Branches**: Each goal creates an independent branch with states: Active 🔵, Completed ✅, Abandoned ❌
- **Commits**: Daily progress records with types: Task Complete ✅, Learning 📚, Life Reflection 🌟, Milestone 🏆
- **Merge**: Successful goals are merged back to master, representing life version upgrades

### MVP Focus (v1.0)
The current development focuses on MVP core features:
- Basic branch management (create, view, switch goal branches)
- Simple commit system (text-based progress recording)
- Master branch view (life timeline and basic statistics)
- Basic merge functionality (goal completion)
- Local data storage
- **AI Task Planning Module**: Uses Deepseek-R1 to generate structured task plans when creating branches

### Core Philosophy
1. **No Psychological Burden**: Encourage users to create goal branches without fear
2. **Flexible Focus**: Switch between branches while maintaining focus on current goals
3. **Growth Visualization**: Completed goals merge to master, showing life progress through versions

### Success Metrics (MVP)
